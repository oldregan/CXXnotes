# CXXnotes
This is my personal notes for reviewing concepts of C++

## Initializer list
1. [A very good explanation see here(chinese)](http://www.cnblogs.com/graphics/archive/2010/07/04/1770900.html)
2. When to use:
  1. Initialize "const" member variables
  2. Initialize reference type member
  3. Initialize class without default constructor
  4. Initialize large size object for performance reason
